# Pedal Power: Decoding the Secrets Behind Bike Purchases

As someone who cycles to work almost daily, I’ve always found joy in the rhythm of pedalling through the city. It clears my mind and gives me a sense of freedom. This personal connection inspired me to explore how factors like commute distance, age, and income influence people’s decisions to buy bikes. I wanted to see if there was a pattern that could help businesses understand their customers better, especially in a market that I hold close to my heart.

## Why this Project?
I decided to focus on bike sales because of my love for cycling and the benefits it brings not just to me but to the environment and health. I thought, “How can understanding my fellow cyclists enhance marketing strategies in the bike industry?” This project became a way to combine my passion with data analysis, making it both personal and practical.
What Readers Will Gain
In this article, you’ll learn about the key factors that drive bike purchases, surprising insights from the data, and how businesses can use these findings to better target their marketing efforts.

## Key Takeaways:
- Higher income levels are linked to increased bike purchases.
- Middle-aged individuals (30-50) are the primary buyers.
- Short commutes significantly boost the likelihood of buying a bike.
- Males typically spend more on bikes than females.

## Dataset Details 

The dataset for this project came from an Excel file featuring 1,000 entries. It included various demographics such as income, age, gender, and commute distances. This rich dataset was perfect for exploring how different factors correlate with bike purchases.

## Analysis Process
I started by cleaning up the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Then, I analysed the relationships between income, age, and commute distance against bike purchase status. I created visualizations to illustrate these findings, which helped me interpret the results more intuitively. One of my biggest surprises was how strongly commute distance impacted purchasing decisions; it turns out, many buyers live quite close to their workplaces, indicating that bikes are often used for short, practical trips.

This graph shows the average income of bike purchasers compared to non-purchasers, revealing that those who buy bikes tend to earn significantly more, especially men.

Here, we see that middle-aged adults are the key demographic, purchasing bikes more than other age groups.
Commute Distance

This visual highlights that a substantial portion of bike sales comes from customers who commute 0-5 miles, underlining the practical use of bikes for short distances.

## Main Takeaways
The insights from my analysis can significantly enhance marketing strategies. Businesses should focus on targeting middle-aged males who earn over $55K annually and live within five miles of urban areas. These demographics are not only the most likely to make purchases but also reflect a lifestyle choice that favours convenience and health.

## Conclusion and Personal Reflections
Through this project, I learned how understanding customer behaviour can lead to smarter marketing decisions. The biggest challenge was interpreting the data and making sense of the patterns. However, overcoming these hurdles has strengthened my analytical skills and sparked my interest in pursuing more data-driven projects in the future.
